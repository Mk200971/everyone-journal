# Architecture Decision Records

## ADR-001: Remove Build Error Ignoring

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** Currently, the build configuration ignores TypeScript and ESLint errors, which hides potential issues.

**Decision:** Remove `ignoreBuildErrors` and `ignoreDuringBuilds` flags and fix all errors.

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Catch errors at build time instead of runtime
- Positive: Improve code quality and type safety
- Negative: Requires immediate work to fix existing errors

## ADR-002: Implement Structured Logging

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** Application uses console.log extensively, which is not suitable for production.

**Decision:** Implement Sentry or similar logging service for production error tracking.

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Better error tracking and debugging
- Positive: Performance monitoring
- Positive: User session replay
- Negative: Additional cost for logging service

## ADR-003: Add Input Validation with Zod

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** Server actions lack runtime validation, relying only on TypeScript types.

**Decision:** Add Zod schemas for all server action inputs.

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Runtime type safety
- Positive: Better error messages
- Positive: Automatic TypeScript type inference
- Negative: Additional code to maintain

## ADR-004: Implement Rate Limiting

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** No rate limiting exists, making the application vulnerable to abuse.

**Decision:** Implement rate limiting using Upstash Redis.

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Protection against abuse
- Positive: Better resource management
- Positive: Improved security
- Negative: Additional infrastructure dependency

## ADR-005: Add Comprehensive Testing

**Status:** Proposed

**Context:** No tests exist, making refactoring risky and bugs more likely.

**Decision:** Implement testing with Vitest and Testing Library.

**Consequences:**
- Positive: Catch bugs early
- Positive: Enable confident refactoring
- Positive: Serve as documentation
- Negative: Initial time investment
- Negative: Ongoing maintenance
